# Part 1: WeatherPy
Create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities of varying distance from the equator utilizing OpenWeatherMap API.

Plots:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Linear Regression Plots:
Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


# Part 2: VacationPy
Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part 1, as in the following image:

Narrow down the DataFrame to find ideal weather condition. For example:


Plot hotels on top of the humidity heatmap, with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country, as in the following image:
